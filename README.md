# Silksong-Lie-Button-Mod
A simple and useless, but charming mod for Silksong. Click a button to toggle laying position. Simple and not abusable.

Mostly without bugs. You'll have to try hard to break anything at all.

It also creates a config in the BepInEx/config/ folder, in which you can change the deafult button. (Deafult = the keyboard button "L")
